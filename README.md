# Demand Forecasting System with Business Evaluation

## 1. Business Problem
Retail teams need reliable demand forecasts to avoid stockouts and overstocking.
This project builds a demand forecasting system and evaluates model performance
using both statistical accuracy and real-world business impact.

## 2. Dataset Overview
Daily retail demand data representing historical product sales.
The dataset captures seasonality, trends, and variability common in real retail environments.

## 3. Approach & Methodology
- Time series exploratory analysis
- Baseline and statistical forecasting models
- Time-based train/validation split
- Forecast evaluation using accuracy and business metrics

## 4. Notebook Walkthrough
- notebooks/01_time_series_eda.ipynb — Demand patterns, trend, seasonality
- notebooks/02_forecasting_models.ipynb — Model training and comparison
- notebooks/03_business_evaluation.ipynb — Translating forecasts into business risk

## 5. Key Insights
(To be filled after modeling)

## 6. Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels / Prophet, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

## 7. Next Improvements
- Multi-item forecasting
- External regressors (promotions, holidays)
- Automated retraining pipelines
